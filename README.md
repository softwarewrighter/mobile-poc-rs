# mobile-poc-rs
A POC for a mobile App/UI written in Rust

Agent instructions: research online how to develop an Android app using Rust (and probably WASM, and possibly Yew),  Build a project to demonstrate this.  This project should use avaialble sensors on different views to show temperature, pressure, accelerometer, magnetic direction, gps, wifi ssids, etc.  Start with a ./docs directory and create markdown files for research (what you find about how to do this, best practices, links), architecture, prd, design, plan, process, and status.  Use TDD Red/Green testing; use pre-commit quality: format code, fix lint warnings (never disable them), fix failing tests, validate .gitignore, update docs as needed.  When quality process completes successfully, commit with a detailed message and push.  

Continue until there is an MVP available for accpetance testing
